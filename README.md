Java scheduling app with SQL integration

Author: Darya Krutyeva dkrutye@wgu.edu

Title of Application: Software 2 Scheduling Application

Description: The purpose of this application is to develop a GUI-based scheduling desktop application using information from an existing SQL Database.
This application will showcase the following competencies:

Database and File Server Applications

The graduate produces database and file server applications using advanced Java programming language constructs to meet business requirements.

4025.1.6 : Lambda

The graduate incorporates lambda expressions in application development to meet business requirements more efficiently.

4025.1.7 : Collections

The graduate incorporates streams and filters in application development to manipulate data more efficiently.

4025.1.8 : Localization API and Date/Time API

The graduate applies the localization API and date/time API in application development to support end-users in various geographical regions.

4025.1.9 : Advanced Exception Control

The graduate incorporates advanced exception control mechanisms in application development for improving user experience and application stability.

Application version: Intellij IDEA 2020.0.03 Community edition
JDK Runtime version: 11.0.09 Open JDK 64bit Server powered by JETBRAINS


Run instructions: Extract the zipfile and load into Intellij. Build and run project.

The additional report I have chose to display in the application as part of the requirement shows the total number of customer per country, so the company
can get a better idea of where the majority of their customers are located, and adjust appointments and marketing accordingly.


THE FOLLOWING REQUIREMENTS WERE MET:

A. Create a log-in form that can determine the user’s location and translate log-in and error control messages (e.g., “The username and password did not match.”) into two languages.

B. Provide the ability to enter and maintain customer records in the database, including name, address, and phone number.

C. Write lambda expression(s) to schedule and maintain appointments, capturing the type of appointment and a link to the specific customer record in the database.

D. Provide the ability to view the calendar by month and by week.

E. Provide the ability to automatically adjust appointment times based on user time zones and daylight saving time.

F. Write exception controls to prevent each of the following. You may use the same mechanism of exception control more than once, but you must incorporate at least two different mechanisms of exception control.

• scheduling an appointment outside business hours • scheduling overlapping appointments • entering nonexistent or invalid customer data • entering an incorrect username and password

G. Use lambda expressions to create standard pop-up and alert messages.

H. Write code to provide reminders and alerts 15 minutes in advance of an appointment, based on the user’s log-in.

I. Provide the ability to generate each of the following reports:

• number of appointment types by month • the schedule for each consultant • one additional report of your choice

J. Provide the ability to track user activity by recording timestamps for user log-ins in a .txt file. Each new record should be appended to the log file, if the file already exists.
